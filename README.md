# Catchy
## Overview

The Catchy App is a real-world wildlife identification and collection application, inspired by the concept of a Pokédex. Users can explore nature, capture photos of animals and plants, and have them recognized and logged into their personal registry. The app provides in-depth information about each species, including habitat, distribution, ecological impact, and conservation status.

## Features

1. **Capture and Identify Wildlife**

    Users can take photos of animals or plants.

    The app utilizes the iNaturalist API to recognize and classify species.

    Successfully identified species are added to the user's registry.

2. **Wildlife Registry**

    Each identified species is stored in the user's personal collection.

    Users can access detailed information, including:

    - **Habitat**: Where the species is commonly found.
    - **Behavior & Ecology**: How the species interacts with its environment.
    - **Climate Change Impact**: How environmental changes affect the species.
    - **Location Map**: A map displaying sightings of the species worldwide.

3. **Friend System & Trading**

    Users can add friends within the app.

    Species can be traded between friends, allowing users to complete their collection collaboratively.

4. **Conservation & Donations**

    Users can donate to conservation efforts directly through the app.

    Donations go towards protecting endangered species and supporting wildlife preservation organizations.

5. **Interactive Map**

    A map interface shows real-time wildlife sightings and distribution data.

    Users can explore where specific species have been observed.

## How It Works

- **Take a Picture** – Use the app to capture an image of a plant or animal.
- **Recognize & Identify** – The app processes the image and provides species information.
- **Add to Registry** – The species is saved to your collection.
- **Learn & Explore** – View details, maps, and conservation status.
- **Trade with Friends** – Exchange species to expand your registry.
- **Support Conservation** – Donate to help protect wildlife.

## Future Enhancements

- **Gamification Features**: Badges, achievements, and leaderboards.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: View species information in AR mode.
- **More Advanced AI Recognition**: Improved accuracy for species identification.
- **Community Challenges**: Compete with friends to discover rare species.
## Conclusion

The Catchy App is an engaging and educational way for users to explore nature, learn about wildlife, and contribute to conservation efforts. With features like species identification, social trading, and donation support, the app bridges technology and environmental awareness, making wildlife discovery an interactive and meaningful experience.
